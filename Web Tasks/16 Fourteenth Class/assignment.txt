1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - Imagine you have a website where users can input text, like a comment box or a search bar.
   - XSS happens when someone enters malicious code into those input fields.
   - This code gets stored on the website's server and then shown to other users who visit the site.
   - When those users view the page, the malicious code runs in their browsers, allowing attackers to steal their data or do other harmful things.
   - <!-- Vulnerable code -->
   - <input type="text" id="username" value="<script>alert('XSS attack!');</script>">



2. **Validation through Regular Expressions**:
   - Validation means checking if something is correct or allowed.
   - Regular expressions (regex) are patterns we use to check if text follows a certain format.
   - For example, we can use a regex pattern to check if an email address looks valid (e.g., has an @ symbol and a dot in the right places).
   - If the text matches the pattern, we say it's valid; if not, it's invalid.

   // Email validation using regular expression
    const email = "example@example.com";
    const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;

    if (emailRegex.test(emailValue)) {
        console.log("Valid email address");
    } else {
        console.log("Invalid email address");
    }


3. **Caching through Service Workers**:
   - Imagine a service worker as a handy helper that sits between your web browser and the internet.
   - When you visit a website, the service worker grabs certain files (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) from the internet and stores them on your computer.
   - The next time you visit the website, instead of downloading those files again, the service worker gives you the ones it stored earlier. This makes the website load faster.
   - It's like having a personal assistant who remembers the things you use often and hands them to you quickly when you need them.
   


4. CORS 
   - CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a security feature that controls how web pages from one origin can access resources from another origin on the internet. It's used to ensure safe communication between different parts of the web.
   - Working : 
    1. **Request**: Web page wants to access resources from a different website.
    2. **Origin Check**: Browser checks if request is from the same origin.
    3. **Cross-Origin Request**: If different origin, browser checks server's CORS policy.
    4. **Preflight Request**: Optional OPTIONS request to ask for permission.
    5. **CORS Headers**: Server responds with CORS headers indicating permissions.
    6. **Access Granted or Denied**: Browser allows or blocks request based on CORS headers.
    7. **Safe Access**: Web page can safely access resource if allowed, otherwise blocked for security.
